MODULE main
--
-- This example model has no meaningful sense. It is purely made up in order to create a setup where one can
-- easily verify that the invariants are enforced or not.
--
-- Indeed, the invariants in this setup are ALWAYS false, which means that any verification with the invar enforced
-- is vacuously true. When the invariant is not enforced, v can non-deterministically take any value.
--
-- Hence, to test the correct enforcement of the invariants, one just needs to verify that [] v holds.

VAR
  v: boolean;

INVAR
  FALSE

LTLSPEC G v -- holds only if the invar is enabled.
