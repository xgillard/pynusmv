OSX INSTALL INSTRUCTION
=======================

On OSX, after you have completed the compilation of PyNuSMV you will probably want to add the following 
three lines to your ~/.profile file:

export PYNUSMV=<path_to_your_pynusmv_root_directory>
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PYNUSMV/src
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PYNUSMV/src/lib


If you intend to extend PyNuSMV using Eclipse, you'll probably want to add the following in the 'environment'
section of your preferred python3 interpreter:
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to_your_pynusmv_root_directory>/src/lib
